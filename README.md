# Movie App Flutter with Provider State Management
## VERSION 1.0

This is simple movie app that made using flutter also implementing Provider state management. This app only contain information about the movie.
Movie data source from (https://www.themoviedb.org/).

I DON'T KNOW WHEN TO FINISH THIS APP. THIS IS ONLY FOR LEARNING AND DOES NOT HAVE MUCH FUNCTIONALITY.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Set Up The App

1. Make sure you have installed Flutter correctly on your computer.
2. Clone or download this repo.
3. Generate API Key for the app, go to TheMovieDB website and get your API Key by registering there.
4. Once you get the API Key, find folder named services, then on the environment file change the apiKey with your API Key.
5. Run command on terminal 'flutter pub get' or update the dependencies manually.
